Data Volume:

1. Each store updates pricing records periodically. Considering 3000 stores, the database should handle millions of records efficiently. PostgreSQL can manage this volume well with proper indexing and query optimization.

2. Authentication is required for accessing the system, using JWT (JSON Web Token) for session management. All endpoints will be secured.

3. Backend deployed using containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy scaling.

4. Regular backups and failover is setup for PostgreSQL.
